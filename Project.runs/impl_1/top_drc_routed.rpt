2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

REQP-1577#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
MMCME2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal clkdv/clkfbout on the clkdv/mmcm/CLKFBOUT pin of clkdv/mmcm does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned and therefore zero hold time at the IO flip-flop(s) may not be met.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1577#2 Warning
Clock output buffering  
MMCME2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal clkdv/clkout3 on the clkdv/mmcm/CLKOUT3 pin of clkdv/mmcm does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>
